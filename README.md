## CLua


## NOTE: the following is the README for Moonbird, not CLua. Will be corrected soon.

Import Lua into Swift.

This module allows you to call the Lua API from Swift, but
the only thing that is available is the bare C API. If you want a
*Swiftier* interface, take a look at the [Moonbird](https://github.com/profburke/moonbird) module.

#### Usage

This module is designed to work with the Swift Package Manager (SPM). In order to use this module you need to do two things:

1. Include `CLua` as a dependency in your `Pacakage.swift` file.
2. Import the module as needed in your Swift source.

An example follows:

###### Package.swift
    let package = Package(
        name: "Sample",
        dependencies: [
          .Package(url: "https://github.com/profburke/clua", majorVersion: 1),
        ]
     )

##### Sample.swift
    import CLua
    
    var L = LuaState()
    


#### TODO

Between various Lua versions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3) and various packaging/naming conventions for different OS distros, the Lua include files and library may not always be in the locations assumed in this code.

It would be nice to have some auto-configure as part of the build process, but at the moment, I'm not sure how to get that to play nicely with the Swift Package Manager. If you have an idea, pull requests greatly appreciated! (*Or opening an issue, would be appreciated as well.*)
